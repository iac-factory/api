/***
 * Middleware that overwrites the default `response` object's statusCode early on in the client-response `callback()`
 *
 * Please note that it's imperative for the following middleware to be explicitly established as one of the first
 * (if not always the first) middleware(s) in the client-response-write chain.
 *
 * Implementation of the following middleware additionally forces consumers to produce their own
 * HTTP status-code; there are arguments for and against such a side-effect, but it's elected
 * as a means for better logging in the current context.
 *
 * Specifically, the Status-Code gets initialized to **100 Continue**:
 *
 * > ### 100 Continue ###
 * > *This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.*
 *
 * See {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/100 100 Continue} for more information
 *
 * Lastly, please note that this is not a 100% compliant **100 Continue** implementation; it's simply a partially
 * compliant means for useful interim server-internal logging.
